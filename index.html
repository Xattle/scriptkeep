    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    This is the beginning of ScriptKeep.<br>
    ScriptKeep will be a place for anyone to keep anything they'd like to type. Kind of like a large, dynamic, text-only, clipboard.<br>
    The biggest goal will be to add in useful context to help keep context (and also help beginning devs know their available options.).

    <!-- You can also require other files to run in this process -->
